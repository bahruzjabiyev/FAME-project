We all remember Abraham Lincoln's wonderful remarks at Gettysburg in which he describes America as a country "of the people, by the people and for the people." Well, with the Citizens United Supreme Court decision we are rapidly becoming a nation of the very rich, by the very rich and for the very rich. And that is a horrendous tragedy. This is not the America that men and women throughout our history fought and died to defend. â€” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)
