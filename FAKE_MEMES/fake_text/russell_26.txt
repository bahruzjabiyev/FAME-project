Honestly, it has reached the stage where I support this idea. America has been trying to move forward for decades now and we can't do it because we are constantly getting monkey wrenched by crazy people. Set aside land and give them their own country. A place for all the religious fanatics, anti abortionists, creationists, gun fetishists, nazis, klansmen, anti taxers, anti vaxers, anti gays. government haters, militiamen and all the other ignorant assholes that have this country in a social stranglehold. Give these imbeciles their own place and get them out of our lives. Then the rest of America can move on and the whole world can enjoy the circus of watching these clueless. sorry assholes buil their 'utopia'. I'm telling you, it would be worth it.
