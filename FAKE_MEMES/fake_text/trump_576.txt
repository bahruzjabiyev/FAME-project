I lie every day because I can and Republicans let me. Today I lied that my father was born in Germany. Everyone knows he was really born in NY. Yesterday I lied that I have a new plan to replace Obamacare. I don't really have another plan. I said that I have already given Puerto Rico 91 billion dollars. I lied. They will get 40 billion over 20 years. Don't worry, I will lie again tomorrow.
