"In the 1980s and 1990s, Jack Welch, the CEO of General Electric, laid off over 100,000 employees. His reward? When he retired from GE, he received a golden parachute of over $400 million dollars. This is th kind of corporate greed and irresponsibility th√§t is destroying the middl class and must be ended." - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)
