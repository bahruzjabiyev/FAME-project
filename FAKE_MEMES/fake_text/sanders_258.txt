"Question: How does it happen that, despite a huge increase in productivity, the median male worker made $783 less last year than he did, in inflation accounted for dollars, 41 years ago? How does it happen that female workers made $1,337 less than in 2007? The answer: The system is rigged. The vast majority of all new income generated in this economy goes to the top 1 percent." - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)
