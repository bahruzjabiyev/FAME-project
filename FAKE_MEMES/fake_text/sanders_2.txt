â€¢r "If we are going to move forward as a country, we must come together, and stop allowing ourselves to be divided... You got into hardcore in '81? Good, congratulations. But we must support young people discovering punk now...let us not criticize or shame them because they've never heard the first Minutmen LP [applause], don't know what CBGB's is, or think Vinnie Stigma is a comic book character [laughter]. I know, right? They'll grow, like you did. They'll learn, just like you did. Don't be the person that pushes them away, and next year they're listening to Avenged Sevenfold, or some other corporate garbage [applause]. Be the person who supports them at the beginning of this wonderful joumey, and be grateful for the new generations keeping the scene alive." - SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT.)
