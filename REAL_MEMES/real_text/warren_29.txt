There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own. NOBODY. You built a factory out there - good for you. But 1 want to be clear. You moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us Laid for. You hired workers the rest ot us Daid to educate. You were safe in your factory because of nolice forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for. You didnt have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factoryâ€ž. Now look. You built a factory and it turned into something terrific or a great idea - God Bless! Keen a Big Hunk of it. But nart of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk ot that and pay forward tor the next Kid who comes along. - Elizabeth Warren facebook.com/beingliberal .org
