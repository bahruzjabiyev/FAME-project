Feminism ... I think the simplest explanation, and one that captures the idea, is a song that Marlo Thomas sang, 'Free to be You and Me.' Free to be, if you were a girl—doctor, lawyer, Indian chief. Anythinq you want to be. And i you're a boy, and you like teaching, you like nursing, you would like to have a doll, that's 0K too. That notion that we should each be free to develop our own talents, whatever thev ma eand not be held back y artificial barriers— manmade barriers, certainly not heaven sent.
