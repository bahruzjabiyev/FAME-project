" You're not taking away anything from heterosexual couples. They would have the very same incentive to marry, all the benefits that come with marriage that they do now." - Justice Ginsburg Happy birthday, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg! What an icon. I was reading about her life, how she cofounded the Women's Rights Project at the ACLU, how she has a certain collar she wears that she calls her "dissenting collar" on the part of the robe that is designed for a man's tie... I definitely want to learn more now.
