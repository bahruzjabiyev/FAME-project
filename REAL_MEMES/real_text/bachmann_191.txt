"As a peopl we are fightiffgato maintain the Heaven-ordained supremacy of the white man over the inferior*lored race; A white flag would thus be emblematical of our cause. Upon a red field would stan ourth our southern cross, Gemmqd, preserving in beautiful contrast the red white Kblue." William T. Tho pson April 23, 1863
