Alexandria Ocasioâ€¢Cortez @Ocasi02018 My dad died when I was 18, my mom scrubbed toilets & drove schoolbuses, I bartended to help her, and still won a Congressional primary at 28. I'll take my family over a fat bank account any day, and my experience makes me a better legislator. I am the people I work for. #RESPECT
