"Religious institutions that use government power in support of themselves and force their views on persons of other faiths, or of no faith, ndermine all our civil rights. Moreover, state support Of an established religion tends to make the clergy unresponsive to their own people, and leads to corruption within religion itself. Erecting the 'wall of separation een church and state,'therefore, is absolutely essential in a free society." Thomas Jefferson
