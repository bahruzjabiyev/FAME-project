"Every constitution written since the end of World War II includes a provision that men and women are citizens of equal stature. Ours does not. I have three granddaughters. I'd like them to be able to take out their Constitution and say 'here is a basic premise of our system, that men and women are persons of equal citizenship stature.' But it's not in there. We just have the equal protection clause, which everyone knows was not meant in the 1860s to change anything with regard to women's status. Women didn't get to vote until 1920.1' Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 2005
