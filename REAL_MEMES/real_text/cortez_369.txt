ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ EXPLAINS DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM ON THE "LATE SHOW" "l believe that in a modern, moral, and wealthy society, no person in America should be too poor to live. What that means to me is health care as a human right, it means that every child no matter where you are born should have access to a college or trade-school education if they so choose it. I think that no person should be homeless if we have public structures or public policy to allow for people to have homes and food and lead a dignified life in the United States." Future of the Democratic Party?
